    <h2 id="back">Background on Koalas</h2>
    
    <p>
    To get right off the bat, koalas are often misnamed "Koala Bears" because of their teddy bear like appereance (wouldn't you want to cuddle them?). They are marsupials that reside primarily in eastern-south Australia. They have gray thick fur, often akin to sheep than to a plushie. They have two opposing thumbs along with 3 other fingers. They also have two toes, fused together on their feet, which acts as their very own grooming device. Their rough hands and feet with thick pads allow Koalas took grab and hang onto trees for upwards of 20 hours each day. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Marsupials are mammals that carry their offspring in a pouch and are endemic (native) to some parts of Australia and the Americas. Marsupials other than koalas include the infamous kangaroos; wallabies, wombats and Tasmanian devils. The koala marsupial (doesn't quite roll of the tongue, does it?), has its pouch open towards the bottom (unlike the kangaroo which opens upward), where the joey (young baby koala) is able to feed on their mother's nutrients to aid in their growth.

    <!--TOC ENTRY: Science and Influence-->
    <h2 id="depth">In-depth, in Both Science and Cuteness</h2>
    
   <p>Koalas typically live in the eucalyptus forests of southeastern and eastern Asia. Their main routine involves only two things, eating and resting. The main diet of koalas only consist of a specific species of eucalyptus tree. Koalas can eat more than a pound of these leaves everyday</p>
    
    <p>Since the eucalyptus leaves koalas prefer is toxic to most other animals, koalas don't have to worry about competition as much. In fact, moisture and hydration is taken care of by their eucalyptus leaves (almost like a match made in heaven) This complements the fact that koalas aren't very active animals. Their slow metabloism doesn't give them the strength that many of their neighbors have. Once they find a comfortable nook in a tree, they'll often sleep for 18-22 hours (if only humans were that powerful).</p>
    
    <p><em>Fun fact: Koalas eat so much eucalyptus that they even take on its smell and will refuse to eat anything other than raw leaves (put some leaves on a dinner plate and a koala would just pass out, not noticing the food).</em></p>
    
    <p>The major carnivorous predators to koala bears are Dingoes, Wild dogs, Bunjils, Big-sized Owls, pythons and Goannas (Monitor Lizards). Koalas can often avoid Dingoes and Wild dogs by camping out in trees but are short out of luck if caught elsewhere on the ground. Owls and eagles can often get a quick meal by catching unsuspecting young koalas. Goannas can catch koalas both on the ground and be able to follow them on a tree.  </p>
    
    <p>
    Koalas are essentially unable to defend itself against predators if caught between a rock and a hungry Dingo. This often makes people attribute koalas to be meek and uninteresting. However, I feel that the koalas calm disposition is one of its defining attributes. A provoked kangaroo will kick the God, Heaven, and Hell out of you; a provoked koala will forget it even got scared and roll over, making them the ideal animal for any aspiring human to pair bond with. Koalas just vibing bro' don't mess with its stuff.

    <!--TOC ENTRY: Unfortuante Threats to Survival (and Why we Should Care) -->
    
    <h2 id="threat">Unfortuante Threats to Survival (and Why We Should Care)</h2>
    
    <p>Due to our (inevitable?) large scale industrialization of society, our adjacent nature (we all are nature technically, the biosphere) often has to be the punching bag of consequences. Koalas especially, due to their pacified nature, are no excpetion.</p>
    
    <p>Koala fur was a popular commodity in the 19th-20th centuries and they were hunted in large numbers. Today, they face one of the greatest threats that any species (including humans) can face, habitat loss (just saying those two words makes my spine chill). Land clearing, deforestation, and bushfires have pushed koalas into smaller and smaller living spaces. Koalas require at least hundred trees per marsupial as its effective range. If that is tampered with, koalas are left vulnerable to their natural predators and even to us as many of the natural biological corridors have been cut down to make place for highways and roads.</p>
    
    <p>One has to look no further than the catastrophic and infamous 2019-2020 wildfires that devestated most forests of east and south Australia. It left hundreds and thousands of koalas displaced, many to die due to the sudden change in environement.</p>
    
    <p>Koalas are currently listed as vulnerable by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN). The IUCN has named koalas as one of the many species vulnerable to climate change (other than us) as the change in climate can degrade the nutritional quality of eucalyptus leaves. This causes koalas to have to search out for water manually, leaving them even more vulnerable.</p>
    
    <p>Koala conservation still fights on. Wildlife hospitals, rescue organizations, zoos, and volunteers are heeding the call to save the koala ("teddy") bears from probable extinction. Activism for koalas has also spread, especially after the traumatic wildfires of early 2020 (feels like forever ago). In fact, you reading this webpage right now can enable you to do your part in saving this endangered species. Tell your friends, family, and comrades about koalas, get them to be interested. Visit zoos and conservation centers, and make sure to support environmentalist groups whenever you can.</p>
    
    <p><b>The extinction of koalas does not only have disastrous implications on the ecosystems of Australia, but has a direct effect on the human condition. No one wants to live in a day where a children's book about koalas becomes outdated for the wrong reasons. Future generations cheated out of something they will never know first hand.</b></p>
